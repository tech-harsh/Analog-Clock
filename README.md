# Analog-Clock
This clock has a white background with a black border and three hands to indicate hours, minutes, and seconds.
The hour hand is the shortest, the minute hand is longer, and the second hand is the longest and colored red.
The clock also has a small black dot in the center to mark the center of the clock.

The JavaScript code uses the setInterval() method to update the clock every second.
It gets the current time using the Date() object and calculates the degrees of rotation for each hand based on the current time 1.
